Hi there. Here begins the project two journey for the Software Engineering Immersive course from General Assembly in Seattle, WA.

My goal is to develop a care network messaging app. The premise is that a perspective user might need therapist advice, so they come to my site to find the therapists near them. Then message them.

I'll use node.js and express, seqauelize, and postgres to accomplish this goal.  Users have the ability to sign up and log in to their message center and update the existing messages if desired or create new ones.

This is a heartfelt goal. I'd like to produce something of value that could have a positive impact.  The project is due Friday, Oct 25th. I'll check in everyday to post results from the previous day's work.  There is much to do. First, initialize npm items in my terminal and get a baseline template working.
